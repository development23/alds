            Artificial intelligence (AI) simulates and mimics human intelligence and it allows computers to learn from experience (data collection), adjust to new experiences, and perform human-like tasks, including repetitive tasks and creative tasks. AI is broadly divided into four types/levels of Artificial Intelligence according to capabilities:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
              <li className="text-gray-600 text-base mb-2"><strong> Reactive Machines - </strong> Reactive machines can neither form memories nor use past experiences for decision-making.</li>
              <li className="text-gray-600 text-base mb-2"><strong> Limited Memory -  </strong> In addition to having the capabilities of reactive machines, AI can also learn from past experiences to make decisions.</li>
              <li className="text-gray-600 text-base mb-2"><strong> Theory of Mind -  </strong> At this level, AI can interact with other intelligent entities by understanding their needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes.</li>
              <li className="text-gray-600 text-base mb-2"><strong> Self-Awareness - </strong> This is the final stage of AI development, where AI develops self-awareness similar to the human brain.</li>
