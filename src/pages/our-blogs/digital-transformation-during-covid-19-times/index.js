                of COVID-19 have made a massive shift. It is no longer about
                traditional communication and searching for information. It is
                more about appropriate use of data, consumption of vast amounts
                of content available on the internet, and engagement of
                individuals, governments, and businesses in digital applications
                to ensure continuity of economic and social activities amidst
                lockdowns imposed all over the world which has disrupted normal

                The transformation of higher education after the inception of
                Covid 19 is worth a watch. Digitalization of classrooms which

                Technologies in studies and assessments of education systems,
                including use of real-time big data, dependence on web 2.0 tools

                health evolving. Companies like Apple and Google came together
                to build a contact- Tracing system for patients. AI-powered
                sensors are helping crowds to identify potentially contagious
                individuals. Robots are monitoring patients and taking over
                higher-risk care tasks such as providing supplies. Physicians
                are using patient-friendly digital tools for routine monitoring
                and diagnosis in multiple diseases. Data mining techniques have
                been employed in studying and assessing diseases of chronic
                nature like pulmonary hypertension. Patient-centric platforms
                have been created to improve the patient recovery journey.

                routine tasks, while other technologies like augmented reality
