      "Kidney failure can be identified as a condition when kidneys lose their ability to remove waste from the body and maintain the level of essential salts and fluids in the body. Diabetes Mellitus is one of the primary causes of kidney failure which is characterized by mounting blood glucose (sugar) levels. The high sugar level in the blood constantly puts pressure on the kidney leading to potential damage of the tiny filtering units in the kidney. The major treatment alternatives include medications, dialysis, and kidney transplant. In case timely action is not taken the condition of the patient deteriorates leading to failure of one or both kidneys.    ",
    description1:
      "The medical terminology used for the condition is diabetic nephropathy or diabetic glomerulosclerosis and studies have shown that around 20 to 30 percent of people suffering from diabetes have the risk of developing kidney diseases. The other problems that can arise include narrowing of the arteries to the kidneys which are known as renovascular disease or renal artery stenosis. A kidney transplant is a final treatment in which a damaged kidney is replaced by a healthy donor kidney.    ",

      "Liver diseases can be referred to as any condition that damages the liver and adversely impacts its functioning. The liver is responsible for performing multiple tasks such as detoxification of waste, managing metabolism, and storage of energy for performing various activities. There is a long list of liver diseases and generally, the damage is an irreversible one. Major liver diseases include Fatty Liver Disease, Hepatitis, Cirrhosis, Cancer, Liver Failure, autoimmune disease, and genetic conditions. For any of these diseases, the general symptoms include nausea, yellowish eyes and skin (jaundice), vomiting, fatigue, itchy skin, reduced appetite, paleness, dark urine, and bloody stools.",
    description1:
      "Liver disease can be diagnosed with the help of a Liver Function Test (LFT), blood test, Ct scans, and liver biopsy in cirrhosis and cancer. In conditions where there is severe liver damage and medications have failed to provide relief, a liver transplant is considered the only treatment option to save a patientâ€™s life. Chronic liver diseases can be managed by adopting a healthy lifestyle which includes maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol intake, drinking ample water, and having a liver-friendly diet that is rich in fiber and less salt, fat, and sugar content.

      "Heart diseases are one of the major reasons for deaths across the world. Having a healthy diet can play a vital role in maintaining heart health and can minimize the risk of heart diseases. This is because the right food manages various risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides level. Green leafy vegetables are a great source of vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. Rich in vitamin K, they promote proper blood clotting and provide protection to the arteries, reduce stiffness and blood pressure levels. Whole grains are rich in fiber content and decrease bad cholesterol (LDL) which is a major reason for heart diseases.",
    description1:
      "Food items like Avocados are a great source of monounsaturated fats that are associated with reduced levels of cholesterol. They are rich in potassium that is considered an essential nutrient for good heart health. Walnuts are yet another food high in micronutrients such as manganese, copper, and magnesium including fiber. They also help in lowering the diastolic blood pressure, stress, and inflammation which can lead to heart diseases. Omega-3 fatty acids offer immense benefits in terms of heart health and they can be found in fatty fish like tuna, salmon, sardines, etc. They enhance artery function, reduce blood pressure and triglycerides level.",

      "A high-risk pregnancy can be referred to as a pregnancy that carries potential complications that can affect the baby, the mother, or both. Such pregnancies require proper care and management to ensure the best outcomes for the baby as well as the mother. Following a healthy lifestyle can significantly reduce the chances of miscarriage due to high-risk pregnancy. First of all, women should achieve a healthy weight before pregnancy as being obese/ overweight during pregnancy can result in the development of various complications such as high blood pressure, stillbirth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia.     ",
    description1:
      "Uncontrolled pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart diseases, or Sexually Transmitted Diseases can also make pregnancy risky. Regular exercise with an intake of healthy and nutritious food can help you manage a balanced and healthy lifestyle. In addition to this, alcohol, tobacco, and drugs should be avoided during pregnancy as they can adversely impact the health of the baby. Further, all these may also cause serious birth defects such as low birth weight in babies and premature delivery. Furthermore, regular prenatal appointments should be scheduled to monitor the health of the developing baby.",
